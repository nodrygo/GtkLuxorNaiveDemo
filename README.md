# GtkLuxorNaiveDemo
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) demo for  [Luxor](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl) draw in [Gtk](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl) canvas

Adapt some Luxor demos    
- Text (_with change color of circle_)  
- Stars  
- Eggs      


very very ugly ack because Luxor is not really adapted to do that
